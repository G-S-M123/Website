        <p><i>A trader is an individual who engages in the buying and selling of financial assets in any financial market, either for themself or on behalf of another person or institution. The main difference between a trader and an investor is the duration for which the person holds the asset. Investors tend to have a longer-term time horizon, while traders tend to hold assets for shorter periods of time to capitalize on short-term trends.Many large financial institutions have trading rooms where traders are employees who buy and sell a wide range of products on behalf of the company. Each trader is given a limit as to how large of a position they can take, the position's maximum maturity and how much of a mark-to-market loss they can have before a position must be closed out. The company has the underlying risk and keeps most of the profit; the trader receives a salary and bonuses.There was a time years ago when the only people who were able to trade actively in the stock market were those working for large financial institutions, brokerages, and trading houses. However, over the past 25 years, developments such as the growth of discount brokerages and online trading, coupled with instantaneous dissemination of news worldwide and very low commissions have leveled the playing—or should we say trading—field. In recent years, the popularity of trading platforms like Robinhood and zero commissions have made it easier than ever for retail investors to attempt to trade like the pros.Day trading can turn out to be a lucrative career (as long as you do it properly). But it can also be a little challenging for novices—especially for those who aren't fully prepared with a well-planned strategy. Even the most seasoned day traders can hit rough patches and experience losses. So, what exactly is day trading, and how does it work?</i></p>
